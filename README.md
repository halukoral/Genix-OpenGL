Genix is a graphics engine based on OpenGL.

I started implementing this graphics engine to improve my own skills and learn the graphics pipeline better.

The source I used while learning OpenGL: https://learnopengl.com/ (I think it's the best source I've found so far.)

Since my main focus was OpenGL learning, I didn't follow OOP rules and software paradigms in the project, but I tried to make the project as explanatory and instructive as I could. 

If there are parts of the commits that don't make sense to you, it's because I'm still learning.
